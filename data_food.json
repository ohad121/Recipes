It should feel just a little warmer than body temperature.  Warm water will rise the dough to the right point for storage in about 2 hours.  With cold water it will need 3-4 hours.\nAdd the yeast to the water in a 5 quart bowl or, preferably, in a resealable, lidded (not airtight) plastic food container or food-grade bucket.  Don't worry about getting it all to dissolve.\nMix in the flour and salt - kneading is unnecessary.  Add all of the flour at once, measuring it in with dry-ingredient measuring cups, by gently scooping up the flour, then sweeping the top level with a knife or spatula.  Don't press down into the flour as you scoop or you'll throw off the measurement.  Mix with a wooden spoon, a high-capacity food processor (14 cups or larger) fitted with the dough attachment, or a heavy duty stand mixer fitted with the dough hook until the mixture is uniform.  If you're hand mixing and it becomes too difficult to incorporate all the flour with the spoon, you can reach into your mixing vessel with very wet hands and press the mixture together.  Don't knead, it isn't necessary.  You're finished when everything is uniformly moist, without dry patches.  It takes a few minutes, and will yield a dough that is wet and loose enough to conform to the shape of its container.\nAllow to rise.  Cover with lid (not airtight or it could explode the lid off).  Allow the mixture to rise at room temperature until it begins to collapse (or at least flattens on the top), approx 2 hours, depending on room temperature, and initial water temperature  Longer rising times, up to 5 hours, won't harm the result.\nYou can use a portion of the dough any time after this period.  Fully refrigerated dough is less sticky and easier to work with than dough at room temperature.\nOn Baking Day:\nprepare your loaf tin, tray, or whatever you're baking it in/on.  Sprinkle the surface of your refrigerated dough with four.  Pull up and cut of a grapefruit-size piece of dough (c 1 lb), using a serrated knife.\nHold the mass of dough in your hands and add a little more flour as needed so it won't stick to your hands.  Gently stretch the surface of the dough around to the bottom on all 4 sides, rotating the ball a quarter-turn as you go.  Most of the dusting flour will fall off - that's fine, it isn't meant to be incorporated.  The bottom of the loaf may appear to be a collection of bunched ends, but it will sort itself out during resting and baking.\nThe correctly shaped final product will be smooth and cohesive.  The entire process should take no more than 30 - 60 seconds.\nRest the loaf and let it rise in the form, on the tray/pizza peel, for about 40 minutes  Depending on the age of the dough, you may not see much rise during this period.  That's fine, more rising will occur during baking.\nTwenty minutes before baking, preheat the oven to 450\u00b0F  Place an empty broiler tray for holding water on any other shelf that won't interfere with the rising bread.\nDust and Slash.  Dust the top of the loaf liberally with flour, which will allow the slashing knife to pass without sticking.  Slash a quarter inch deep cross, diagonal lines, or tic-tac-toe pattern on top using a serrated knife.\nAfter a 20 min preheat you're ready to bake, even though the oven thermometer won't be at full temperature yet.  Put your loaf in the oven.  Pour about 1 cup of hot water (from the tap) into the broiler tray and close the oven to trap the steam.\nBake for about 30 minutes, or until the crust is nicely browned and firm to the touch.\nStore the rest of the dough in the fridge in your lidded (not airtight) container and use it over the next 14 days.  The flavour and texture improves, becoming like sourdough.  Even 24 hours of storage improves the flavour.\nThis is the standard bread.  There are loads of variations - both savory and sweet - in the book.\n", "img": "https://img.sndimg.com:443/food/image/upload/c_thumb,q_80,w_562,h_316/v1/img/recipes/32/55/71/pick0Pu8J.jpg", "url":

Cups 100% Whole Grain Wheat Flour. (to cool the water and end up with warm dough) Mix then add 2 Tbs of Dry Active Yeast. If your not sure about your yeast proof it in a little warm water first.\nAdd: 4 Cups of 100% Whole Grain Wheat Flour.\nMix until the consistency is some what even. Then continue to slowly add flour 1/2 Cup at a time until the dough quits sticking to the sides of the bowl. It should be tacky to the touch. The trick is to have enough consistency to stand up with the least amount of flour so the bread will be fluffy. It will most likely be 6 1/2 cups but in any case do not exceed 7 1/2 cups of wheat flour. You can trade one cup of wheat flour for one cup of all purpose white if you wish. Don't over mix or the bread will be tough.\nWhen your dough is finished, leave it in the mixer, cover the bowl and let it rise for about 30-45 minutes. The dough will be larger but it doesn't need to double.\nGrease two bread pans with Crisco. You can also flour the pans to reduce sticking.\nMix the dough again just enough to knock it down at least close to the original size.\nDrop the dough on a floured surface so you can work the dough and shape it. Shape it with your hands to make a nice ball getting enough flour on it so it isn't sticky. Divide the ball in half and do it again. Shape the loaves by turning the dough under it's self over and over. When the dough is shaped the sides and ends will be sealed and all you will see is a nice oblong shaped loaf with smooth sides and top. Drop the loaves in your bread pans and let them rise until almost doubled. Bake in a preheated oven at 350 for 36 minutes. If you forgot to preheat 41 minutes. (gas oven).\nWhen done turn the bread out of the pan to a rack to cool. You can eat it right away (a great time for real butter) don't wrap it until completely cooled. (Condensation will make it soggy) Put in tinfoil to store on the counter. If you put it in the refrigerator it will turn into a brick.

Pull a fork lengthwise through the flesh to separate it into long strands, (See photos.).\nYou can do these steps ahead of time, then prepare any of the spaghetti squash recipes whenever the mood strikes.\nBUYING & STORING.\nWhen buying spaghetti squash, look for hard fruit that is heavy for its size, about eight to nine inches in length and four to five inches in diameter and with a pale even color. Avoid any squash with soft spots and green color is a sign of immaturity. The average four-pound spaghetti squash will yield about five cups.\nSpaghetti Squash can be stored at room temperature for about a month. After cutting, wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate up to 2 days. Spaghetti squash also freezes well. Pack cooked squash into freezer bags, seal, label and freeze. Partially thaw before re-using, then steam until tender but still firm, about 5 minutes.\n", "img": "https://img.sndimg.com:443/food/image/upload/c_thumb,q_80,w_562,h_316/v1/img/recipes/77/55/4/PqIb47KPSuu9QNvGmZqt_spaghetti_squash2.jpg", "url": "https://www.food.com/recipe/how-to-cook-spaghetti-squash-77554"}, {"title": "Chicken Pesto", "ingredients": ["pesto sauce mix", "boneless skinless chicken breasts", "breadcrumbs", "provolone cheese", "mushrooms"], "ingredientsDisplay": ["1 package pesto sauce mix", "8 boneless skinless chicken breasts", "breadcrumbs", "4 slices provolone cheese, cut in half ", "1 (4 ounce) can sliced mushrooms"], "directions": "Prepare pesto sauce according to package direction.\nHeat oven to 350 degrees.\nSpray rectangular dish (9 by 12 inch) with no-stick spray.\nMoisten chicken with water, shake off excess, and coat complete with bread crumbs.\nPlace chicken in baking dish.\nSpread pesto sauce evenly over chicken breasts.\nCover each breast with \u00bd slice of provolone cheese.\nSpread mushrooms over cheese.\nBake in oven for 45- 50 minutes.\nServe with pasta.\n", "img": "https://img.sndimg.com:443/food/image/upload/c_thumb,q_80,w_570,h_321/v1/img/recipes/21/88/2/aQOJTNSRJ646PEVTXTbD-Pesto-Chicken-2.jpg", "url": "https://www.food.com/recipe/chicken-pesto-21882"}, {"title": "Authentic Mexican Pozole", "ingredients": ["1 1\u20442 lbs pork shoulder", "garlic cloves", "cumin powder", "onion", "garlic cloves", "2 tablespoons oil", "black pepper", "cayenne", "chili powder", "salt", "oregano", "white hominy", "pork broth", "diced green chilis", "salt", "2 whole fresh jalapenos, chopped (optional)", "ancho chilies"], "ingredientsDisplay": ["1 1\u20442 lbs pork shoulder", "2 garlic cloves, peeled ", "1 tablespoon cumin powder", "1 onion, chopped ", "2 garlic cloves, chopped ", "2 tablespoons oil", "1\u20442 teaspoon black pepper", "1\u20442 teaspoon cayenne", "2 tablespoons california chili powder", "1 tablespoon salt", "1\u20444 teaspoon oregano", "4 cups canned white hominy, drained and rinsed ", "3 -5 cups pork broth, from cooking pork shoulder ", "1 cup canned diced green chilis (optional)", "salt", "2 whole fresh jalapenos, chopped (optional)", "3 whole ancho chilies, seeded and stemmed (garnish) (optional)"], "directions": "This recipe requires a simple prep.\nPrepare the onion, peel the garlic, chop the onion, peel and chop the 2 garlic cloves, chop the green chilies and jalapenos if you are using them and get the hominy drained and rinsed.\nI boil my ancho chilies in a separate small pot for the garnish part(read below).\nNow you are ready to cook.\nPlace the meat in a large saucepan and just cover with lightly salted water.\nAdd 1/2 chopped onion, the 2 cloves peeled garlic, pepper, cumin, and oregano.\nBring to a boil over medium heat, skim off any foam that rises, reduce heat, cover and simmer for 45 minutes.\nRemove meat and broth, reserving both.\nSaute the remaining chopped onion and garlic in oil until translucent.\nAdd the remaining spices, stir for a minute.\nCut the reserved pork into 1 inch cubes and add to the pan.\nStir in the canned hominy, pork broth (if there is not enough pork broth, add chicken stock, I like to add it anyway for flavor, about 2-4 cups, eyeball the amount you like), green chilies and jalapenos (optional).\nCook at a simmer, covered, for 45 to 60 minutes until the meat and hominy are tender.\nIf necessary, cook for up to an additional 60 minutes until the chilies and onions are well blended into the broth.\nDegrease the stew, taste for salt, and serve in soup bowls.\nThis is a delicious recipe and well worth the effort to make.\nGarnishes that are always served with are:\nlots of lime/lemon wedges.\nsliced radishes.\nchopped cilantro.\nShredded cabbage(not red).\nfresh/ packaged fried corn tortillas.\nWhen my ancho chilies are soft from boiling(takes about 15 minutes), then i put them in the blender with 1 1/2cups of water, 1 clove of garlic and about 2 tablespoons diced onion, and about 1 tablespoons of salt and pepper.

Adjust +/- according to your oven's accuracy and heat retention. NOTE:\nIF YOU HAVE AN OVEN PROBE OR THERMOMETER THAT HAS A WIRE THAT GOES THROUGH THE SIDE OF THE OVEN DOOR, BY ALL MEANS USE IT AND SET THE TEMPERATURE ALARM FOR 140 DEGREES.  REMOVE MEAT FROM OVEN WHEN ALARM ALERT GOES OFF (probably before an hour has expired).\nTurn oven OFF and DO NOT open oven door for 45 to 1 hour, OR sooner IF you are using a probe thermometer and it alerts that internal meat temp is at 140 degrees.  Remove pork from oven, lightly cover with foil, and let rest 5-10 minutes to redistribute internal juices.  Roast should be done, very slightly pink in the center, and very moist.\nAfter resting 10 minutes, the roast should reach a safe 145-150 degrees.\nNOTE:******* For anyone questioning this method of cooking, it really does reach the proper internal temperature on a thermometer.  According to Sara Moulton on FoodTV, trichinosos is killed at 138 degrees, and 145 is a safe temperature for pork, although the USDA recommends 160 degrees (meat will be much drier).

They all come out good, but the Betty Crocker does come out the best.\nI was having a problem with my cookies flattening while baking.  This usually happens with the generic cake mix brands.  You can play with your oven temp and try them on 375 to keep them from spreading.  Adding more oil than called for will also cause the cookies to spread -- I wouldn't suggest it, they really don't need extra oil.\nAnother way to keep them nice and thick and to get the most \"crinkled\" or \"crackled\" look is to make them bigger.

Also GREAT to use a Food Saver or other Vacuum device to Vacuum pack/seal the meat with Marinade. With this method, you can achieve Overnight-level marinade in just a couple hours!\nRemove loin from tray, and place on a slotted bake sheet with a drip pan or aluminum foil below to catch dripping. Don't throw away marinade.\nWrap a piece of bacon around the very end of the  tenderloin, securing the bacon strip with a toothpick.\nRepeat this process until the entire loin is wrapped in ten or so bacon \"loops.\" The tenderloin should look like an arm with a bunch of wrist watches on it, the watches being the bacon strips.\nDrizzle remaining marinade over deer loin. You can continue to baste the loin with the marinade throughout the cooking process with either a brush or a turkey baster.\nPlace on center rack in oven and bake at 350\u00b0F for 30-40* minutes. *This should cook the meat to about Medium. For those of you who prefer rare meat (like me), cut the time to 25-30 minutes and then follow with the \"OPTION 2\" step below regarding searing.\nOPTION 1 - with about 10 minutes of cooking time left, you can lightly dust the top of the loin with white sugar. This creates a sweet crust on top of the bacon. Might be too sweet for some. Try doing it on just HALF of the loin to see if you like it!\nOPTION 2 - For a crispier crust and crispier bacon, remove Loin from oven and place the Loin(s) directly on a Grill over medium-high heat to sear the bacon and outer loin. (Thanks to all of you reviewers who taught me this. It's a great step for those of us who like a cooked crust and a pink center).\nRemove from oven and place on cutting board. Using a knife, cut the loin between each strip of bacon so that you have many pieces of meat, each with their own toothpick.\nYou can eat these pieces directly from the toothpick or remove the toothpick and eat like steak. You can thank me later.\nThe next day, try the leftovers on a wheat bun with spicy BBQ Saucefor an awesome leftover sandwich.\n", "img": "https://img.sndimg.com:443/food/image/upload/c_thumb,q_80,w_567,h_319/v1/img/recipes/13/96/64/picvzOjgf.jpg", "url": "https://www.food.com/recipe/sweet-bacon-wrapped-venison-tenderloin-139664"}, {"title": "Slow Cook Down Home Pork Chops and Gravy", "ingredients": ["all-purpose flour", "dry mustard", "salt", "garlic powder", "boneless pork chops", "condensed chicken broth", "2 tablespoons vegetable oil"], "ingredientsDisplay": ["1\u20442 cup all-purpose flour", "1 1\u20442 teaspoons dry mustard", "1\u20442 teaspoon salt", "1\u20442 teaspoon garlic powder", "6 lean boneless pork chops (1 in. thick)", "1 (10 3/4 ounce) can condensed chicken broth", "2 tablespoons vegetable oil"], "directions": "Combine 1st four ingredients in a shallow dish.\nDredge chops in flour mixture and set aside.\nCombine what is left of the flour mixture w/ the chicken broth and pour into your crock pot.\nPour oil into a large skillet and cook the chops in hot oil until browned on both sides.\nPlace chops in crock pot and cook covered on High for about 2 to 5 hours or until tender.\nServe w/ hot rice and/or mashed potatoes.\n++If the gravy becomes too thick just add a little water.

On mine it's 450, but use 500 if your oven goes that high.\nDo not wash the turkey!  The USDA says that washing it could cause a spread of salmonella poisoning.  Sprinkle salt in the cavities. Stuff if desired.  Don\u2019t pre-stuff your turkey; mix and stuff ingredients immediately before roasting. Tossing in a few pieces of cut fruit or herbs is not considered 'stuffing.'  Stuffing usually means filling up the cavity with about \u00be cup stuffing per pound of turkey.\nRub the entire bird with olive oil or butter. Doctor up your bird with whatever special seasonings you wish.  I always use poultry seasoning. Finish with a good sprinkle of seasoning salt and black pepper.\nI highly recommend using a wired thermometer so you can watch the temperature without lifting the lid.  Your turkey will be done much earlier than the estimated cook time, so keep a sharp eye on that thermometer.  If using a pop-up turkey plug type thermometer, those little pop-ups stick sometimes so you should really use two of them.\nPut the rack into the insert pan and make sure the handles are up, not tucked below.  Put the bird in the insert pan on top of the rack.  Don\u2019t add water to the pan. Put the insert pan back into the roasting pan.  If your roaster doesn't have an insert pan, it's ok - just be very careful putting the bird into that hot oven, you don't want to burn your hands on the sides of the oven! Cover.\nRoast at highest setting for 30 minutes.  The butter/oil, seasonings and the searing time will make the skin beautifully browned and perfect!\nAfter 30 minutes, turn the oven temperature down to 325.\nThe turkey will self-baste if you do not lift the lid, so you don't have to baste it every 20 minutes like you do in your conventional oven. DO NOT LIFT LID during cooking time!  Lifting the lid will increase cooking time because roaster ovens lose their heat unlike regular ovens.   I've read that roaster ovens effectively 'steam' the turkey making the meat come out  --  well, steamed.  This is not true as you will find out.  Similar to the roasted chickens you can get at your supermarket, the bird will come out moist and perfectly roasted.  Why do you think they call it a Roaster Oven?.\nFigure your total cooking time from the time you first put the bird in the roaster.  The Butterball website has a great calculator:\nhttp://www.butterball.com/calculators-and-conversions.\nFINAL TEMPERATURE FOR SAFETY AND DONENESS IS: 180 DEGREES IN THIGH AND 165 DEGREES IN BREAST AND STUFFING. Juices should be clear, not pink.\nCheck your turkey EARLY.  Really start watching the temp an hour before it's supposed to be done. Your turkey will almost certainly be done before the suggested cooking time.  Watch your wired meat thermometer.  If using a pop-up turkey plug type thermometer, check by lifting the lid quickly so the oven doesn\u2019t lose its heat.  If necessary, check after another 30 minutes, but I doubt you'll have to do that.  I say check after 30 minutes because it's really OK to let the bird roast a little extra - you won't dry it out using my method if you let it go for 1/2 hour.\nWhen done, remove the turkey from the roaster, tent with foil, and let rest for 20 minutes.  This allows the juices to really seep into the meat, so they say.\nIf you try this method, please let us know your results!\nHappy Thanksgiving everyone!\n", "img": "https://img.sndimg.com:443/food/image/upload/c_thumb,q_80,w_611,h_344/v1/img/recipes/33/94/53/rcfkZBSm64Sg49Uxmfzg_roast-turkey-1.jpg", "url": "https://www.food.com/recipe/perfect-turkey-in-an-electric-roaster-oven-339453"}, {"title": "Uncle Bill's Vegetarian Minestrone Soup", "ingredients": ["extra virgin olive oil", "onion", "water", "zucchini", "carrot", "cannellini beans", "celery", "dried basil", "dried oregano", "salt", "fresh coarse ground black pepper", "canned plum tomatoes", "garlic cloves", "elbow macaroni"], "ingredientsDisplay": ["1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil", "3\u20444 cup chopped onion", "3 cups water", "2 cups diced zucchini", "1 cup diced carrot, peeled ", "1 cup canned cannellini beans or 1 cup you may use other white beans", "3\u20444 cup diced celery", "1 teaspoon dried basil or 2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh basil", "1\u20444 teaspoon dried oregano", "1\u20444 teaspoon salt", "1\u20448 teaspoon fresh coarse ground black pepper", "28 fluid ounces canned plum tomatoes, dice and include liquid ", "2 garlic cloves, minced ", "1\u20444 cup uncooked ditalini or 1/4 cup elbow macaroni"], "directions": "Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat.\nAdd chopped onion and saut\u00e9 for 4 minutes or until just lightly browned.\nAdd water, zucchini, carrots, canellini beans, celery, basil, oregano salt, pepper, tomatoes and garlic.\nBring to boil;

The best will disappear first.\nDo not freeze.\nPick out a nice thick slab checking the sides to make sure it isn't a very gristly one.\nFeel it because some butchers fold it over hiding the gristle if there is a lot of it.\nThere will always be some gristle and it runs the length of the slab in the center.\nThe thicker the slab the better. If you are lucky, you may see some chunk style at a higher price per pound.\nIf there isn't a spice bag in with the brisket, you will need to get some whole peppercorns (white and black) and bay leaves.\n------------Selecting the Cabbage-------------------.\nThe heavier and more solid it is, the better it is.\nSmell it to make sure it isn't too bitter.\nYou may have to go to another store if the whole batch has a very strong bitter smell. I have had to visit several stores to find a decent batch.\nKeep in mind that the outer leaves will be discarded even if the store has already removed the natural outer leaves to make them look better and fresher.\n--------------Selecting the Potatoes----------------.\nWatch out for the red dyed ones.\nPick out a bag of medium to small sized ones.\nThe smaller the better.\nIf you are lucky enough to find the ones as small as salad tomatoes, they are the best.\n-------------Selecting the Carrots----------.\nGet the smallest bag they have unless you like carrots, because you will only use one per pot of cabbage to take any bitterness out of the cabbage.\nServing a bowl of carrots is a big no no on Saint Patrick's Day.\nPreparing and cooking the meal-----------------------.\n(It's going to take 3 hours with you there).\nUse a large Dutch oven or stock pot that will hold everything all at once.\nPlace the brisket (best side up) in the bottom of the pot.\nThere's no need to rinse it because nothing bad will survive what you are about to do to it and you will remove the outer marinate.\nAdd the spice packet or a teaspoonful of peppercorns and two bay leaves.\nCover the brisket generously with water and a bottle of beer (optional - adds flavor and is a tenderizer).\nBring to a boil.\nReduce heat, cover and simmer for 2 hours.\nDuring the 2 hours------------------------.\nScrub and rinse the new red potatoes.\nRemove any eyes and bad spots.\nLeave as much of the peel as you can.\nQuarter them (halve or whole if tiny).\nCover with water until ready for them.\nRemove the outer leaves from the cabbage until the leaves are entirely light green, rinse and cut it into quarters through the spine so they stay together.  Set aside.\nPeel one carrot and cut it into quarters.  Set aside.\nPeel the onion and cut it into eighths.  Set aside.\nRinse the bunch of fresh parsley and chop up just the tops into very tiny pieces.\nI find that kitchen scissors do just fine.\nAfter the 2 hours----------------------.\nAdd the potatoes on top of the brisket.\nAdd water to cover everything.\nBring to a boil.\nReduce heat, cover and simmer for 10 minutes.\nAdd the cabbage on top of the potatoes and add onion and carrot on top of the cabbage.\nAdd water to cover everything.\nBring to a boil.\nReduce heat, cover and simmer for 20 minutes.\nCheck the cabbage to see if it is tender.\nIf not, simmer another 5 minutes. You shouldn't undercook it and it's hard to overcook it.\nWhen done-----------------------.\nIn a large serving bowl where you can stir the potatoes, crush the garlic clove and rub the inside of the bowl with it.\nPlace the potatoes in the bowl while still piping hot and add (at least) a quarter pound of butter and add a handful (more is better than less) of chopped fresh parsley.\nGently stir until butter is melted, it coats all the potato pieces and the parsley is evenly distributed.\nPut the rest of the parsley into a tiny serving bowl for those who want to add more to their potatoes.\nAs I said, more is better.\nSlice the brisket cross grain.\nHope there is leftovers for breakfast.\nSee my March 18th Breakfast! It's a family tradition. We make sure we make enough to ensure leftovers for breakfast the next morning. Finely chopped fried corned beef and cabbage (the entire meal) and coffee is divine. We throw in any leftover parsley.\n", "img": "https://img.sndimg.com:443/food/image/upload/c_thumb,q_80,w_566,h_318/v1/img/recipes/15/84/6/DbERKvW9SWeTU3BYvVxR_DSC_0790.jpg", "url": "https://www.food.com/recipe/n-y-c-corned-beef-and-cabbage-15846"}, {"title": "Baked Stuffed Pasta Shells", "ingredients": ["jumbo pasta shells", "mozzarella cheese", "parmesan cheese", "ricotta cheese", "eggs", "nutmeg", "black pepper", "garlic powder", "dried parsley", "8 ounces spaghetti sauce (jarred or homemade)", "fresh basil"], "ingredientsDisplay": ["12 ounces jumbo pasta shells", "1 1\u20444 cups mozzarella cheese, shredded (Reserve 1/4 cup)", "1 cup parmesan cheese, grated ", "2 lbs ricotta cheese", "2 large eggs, lightly beaten and 2 egg yolks ", "1 pinch nutmeg", "1 teaspoon black pepper", "1 teaspoon garlic powder", "1 tablespoon dried parsley", "8 ounces spaghetti sauce (jarred or homemade)", "fresh basil, chopped, for garnish "], "directions": "In an 8 quart pot, bring water to a boil and cook shells for 8 minutes or until al dente.\nDrain and cool immediately with cold water.\nDrain and place open side down on paper towels.\nIn a medium bowl, combine the rest of ingredients except the spaghetti sauce.\nReserve the 1/4 cup of Mozzarella.\nPlace a thin layer of spaghetti sauce into the bottom of a 12 x 9 x 2 inch baking dish.\nPreheat oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit.\nSpoon the cheese mixture into each pasta shell and place open side up, in a single layer, in prepared pan.\nPour the rest of sauce over the stuffed shells.\nLoosely cover with foil and bake for 40 minutes.\nDuring last 5 minutes of baking, remove foil and sprinkle remaining Mozzarella cheese on top.\nBake 5 more minutes.\nGarnish with fresh chopped basil.\n", "img": "https://img.sndimg.com:443/food/image/upload/c_thumb,q_80,w_567,h_319/v1/img/recipes/10/66/18/732WWU1oR1ywcQ845cmu_SBS 4 -

If you prefer a softer crust (like a traditional bread) mix the butter into the batter instead of pouring it over the top.\nSifting flour for bread recipes is a must-do. Most people just scoop the 1 cup measure in the flour canister and level it off. That compacts the flour and will turn your bread into a \"hard biscuit\" as some have described. That's because they aren't sifting their flour! If you do not have a sifter, use a spoon to spoon the flour into the 1 cup measure. Try it once the \"correct\" way and you will see an amazing difference in the end product.\nI have had many email from you kind folks about using non-alcoholic beverages instead of beer. That is fine to do but I highly recommend adding a packet of Dry Active Yeast or 2 teaspoons of Bread (Machine) Yeast so that you get a proper rise.\nThe final result should be a thick, hearty and very tasteful bread, NOT A BRICK! ;).\nThank you all for the incredibly nice comments and those of you who left a bad review - learn to sift sift SIFT!

This works very nicely.\nCOOKING TIMES: Left Side -Stuffed---- Right Side - Unstuffed.\n*12-14lbs.\n4 - 4 1/2 hours-- 3 1/2 - 3  3/4 hours.\n*14-16lbs.\n4 1/2 - 5 hours-- 3 3/4 - 4

1/4 hours.\nNOTE:  Test for doneness by inserting a meat thermometer in the thickest part of the breast, reading should be 175 F and in the thickest part of the leg or thigh, reading should be 180\u00b0F.\n", "img": "https://img.sndimg.com:443/food/image/upload/c_thumb,q_80,w_601,h_338/v1/img/recipes/46/26/2/pIrmxRfQm6ke6zgotpMw_IMG_7142 turkey.jpg", "url":

reserve.\nPre-heat the oven to 450\u00b0F.\nPut the tablespoon of olive oil in a large (9\" - 10\" wide, 3\" deep) fireproof casserole and warm over moderate heat.\nSaute the lardons for 2 to 3 minutes to brown lightly.\nRemove to a side dish with a slotted spoon.\nDry off the pieces of beef and saute them, a few at a time in the hot oil/bacon fat until nicely browned on all sides.\nOnce browned, remove to the side plate with the bacon.\nIn the same oil/fat, saute the onion and the carrot until softened.\nPour off the fat and return the lardons and the beef to the casserole with the carrots and onion.\nToss the contents of the casserole with the salt and pepper and sprinkle with the flour.\nSet the uncovered casserole in the oven for four minutes.\nToss the contents of the casserole again and return to the hot oven for 4 more minutes.\nNow, lower the heat to 325\u00b0F and remove the casserole from the oven.\nAdd the wine and enough stock so that the meat is barely covered.\nAdd the tomato paste, garlic and herbs and the bacon rind.\nBring to a simmer on the top of the stove.\nCover and place in the oven, adjusting the heat so that the liquid simmers very slowly for three to four hours.\nThe meat is done when a fork pierces it easily.\nWhile the meat is cooking, prepare the onions and mushrooms and set them aside till needed.\nFor the onion, if using frozen, make sure they are defrosted and drained.\nHeat the butter and oil in a large skillet and add the onions to the skillet.\nSaute over medium heat for about ten minutes, rolling the onions about so they brown as evenly as possible, without breaking apart.\nPour in the stock, season to taste, add the herbs, and cover.\nSimmer over low heat for about 40 to 50 minutes until the onions are perfectly tender but retain their shape and the liquid has mostly evaporated.\nRemove the herbs and set the onions aside.\nFor the mushrooms, heat the butter and oil  over high heat in a large skillet.\nAs soon as the foam begins to subside add the mushrooms and toss and shake the pan for about five minutes.\nAs soon as they have browned lightly, remove from heat.\nTo Finish the Stew:\nWhen the meat is tender, remover the casserole from the oven and empty its contents into a sieve set over a saucepan.\nWash out the casserole and return the beef and bacon to it (discarding the bits of carrot and onion and herbs which remain in the sieve).\nDistribute the mushrooms and onions over the meat.\nSkim the fat off the sauce and simmer it for a minute or two, skimming off any additional fat which rises to the surface.\nYou should be left with about 2 1/2 cups of sauce thick enough to coat a spoon lightly.\nIf the sauce is too thick, add a few tablespoons of stock.\nIf the sauce is too thin, boil it down to reduce to the right consistency.\nTaste for seasoning.\nPour the sauce over the meat and vegetables.\nIf you are serving immediately, place the covered casserole over medium low heat and simmer 2 to 3 minutes.\nServe in the casserole or on a warm platter surrounded by noodles, potatoes or rice and garnished with fresh parsley.\nIf serving later or the next day, allow the casserole to cool and place cold, covered casserole in the refrigerator.\n20 minutes prior to serving, place over medium low heat and simmer very slowly for ten minutes, occasionally basting the meat and vegetables with the sauce.\n", "img": "https://img.sndimg.com:443/food/image/upload/c_thumb,q_80,w_562,h_316/v1/img/recipes/14/80/07/S172F1B1RHSYIHC5YYNo_beef-bourguingon-5065.jpg", "url":

Pour over the ginger ale. Cover and cook on LOW for about 12 hours. See Note2 below regarding amount of time needed!\nRemove the meat, strain and save the onions, discard all liquid. With two forks, shred the meat, discarding any remaining fat, bones or skin. Most of the fat will have melted away.\nReturn the shredded meat and the onions to the crock pot, stir in the barbecue sauce. Continue to cook for another 4 to 6 hours on LOW.\nServe with hamburger buns or rolls and additional barbecue sauce. Any leftovers freeze very well.\nTIP: freeze ready-made sandwiches - a scoop of meat on a bun, well-wrapped. These make a great quick meal or snack. To reheat, remove wrapping, wrap in a paper towel, and zap 1-2 minute in the microwave.\nNote: Shoulder or butt are recommended because the meat shreds very well. Other cuts do not shred as readily. It is a fattier cut, but the fat melts away in the cooking and is poured away when you discard the liquid.\nNote 2: I have an older, smaller crock pot. The above times work perfectly for me. But if you have a newer or bigger crock pot, you may need to revise times downward, esp. after the bbq sauce is added. I think you need at least a couple of hours for it all to meld, but that may be all you need. Update: I recently bought a bigger crockpot, I think 5 or 6 qts. I cooked a 6 lb pork shoulder in it for 8 hours and it was shreddable at that point. Shredded, added the sauce, and cooked for another hour or so to meld everything. So use your best judgment on timing!\nNote3: You might want to turn your roast over after it's cooked a while, to ensure more even cooking.

Toss in as much salt (to taste) and a couple pinches of parsley. Then whisk in that olive oil with a fork. Turn off your burner.\nArrange your tasty crustaceans in a 9x13 baking dish, brushing each leg with the sauce. ***TASTY TIP*** I use an injector to pop a *little* extra UMPH into my crabs. Pour any remaining sauce over those puppies. Now toss the pan into the oven on the center rack.\nBake your crabs for about 25 minutes or so (depending on how thick the legs you have are), brushing the sauce from the bottom of the pan onto the legs every 5-7 minutes. Remove from oven. Sprinkle with a few pinches o' parsley for garnish.\nI am a lazy gal, detest doing more dishes than I have to, and am a firm believer in the \"waste not, want not\" phrase. With that said, I just serve the crab in the same dish I baked it in so I can dip the meat into the tasty sauce, savoring every last drop. If you are the opposite, use tongs and place them on a platter and pour the buttery-goodness into ramekins. VOILA!

until pureed and thoroughly smooth. Transfer mixture to measuring cup and reserve exactly 2 cups. Discard excess.\nRemove ribs and seeds from 2 jalapenos and discard. Mince flesh and set aside. Mince remaining jalapeno. Set aside.\nPlace rice in a fine mesh strainer and rinse under cold running water until water runs clear- about 1 1/2 minutes.Shake rice vigorously to remove excess water.This step removes the starch from the rice so it will not stick. IF YOU OMIT THIS STEP YOUR RICE WILL NOT BE DRY AND FLUFFY.\nHeat oil in heavy bottomed ovensafe 12 inch straight sided sautee pan or Dutch oven with tight fitting lid over low-medium heat about 2 minutes. (The recipe is very specific about this but I used a 10 inch dutch oven and it worked out fine.) Drop a few rice grains in and if they sizzle then it is ready. Add rice and fry stirring until rice is light golden and translucent, about 6-8 minutes.  Be careful that the oil doesn't get too hot too fast or the oil will splatter.\nReduce heat to medium, add garlic and 2 minced jalapenos and cook , stirring constantly until fragrant, about 1 1/2 minutes.\nStir in broth, pureed mixture,tomato paste, and salt. Increase heat to medium high, and bring to a boil.\nCover pan and transfer pan to oven to bake until liquid is absorbed and rice is tender, 30-35 minutes.Stir well after 15 minutes.\nStir in cilantro, minced jalapeno to taste, and pass lime wedges separately.\nEdited to add 6-15-05: If you can't get good fresh tomatoes you are better off using canned tomatoes. Don't use those awful hard and underipe tomatoes that are at most supermarket chains. Just be sure that the processed tomatoes and the one onion equals 2 cups. One the other hand- if you find that after processing your tomatoes and onions that you have less than 2 cups- simply add enough bottled salsa to make up the difference.\nEdited 8-21-06: Do not skip any of the steps. It may seem stupid- but rinsing the rice to remove the starch is very important if you want fluffy rice. It will only take two minutes of your time but it makes the difference.\nEdited 8-15-08: Leftovers are just as delicious the next day so this is a perfect dish to make ahead time for potlucks. This rice also freezes well. For Freezing Ahead: Cool, portion and freeze in a ziploc bag. To reheat from frozen: Place in a pyrex dish and warm in the microwave, stirring every 2-3 minutes until heated through.\nYou'll love this rice!

Where there's a will, there's a way! Improvising is fine.\nMelt butter in a 9 inch square pan. I stick my pan and butter in the oven for a few minutes.
